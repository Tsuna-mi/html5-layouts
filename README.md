# html5-layouts

##Semantic Markup challenge

- Create a new repository called html5-layouts on your github account and clone it on your machine
- Create index.html and inside of it do the markup (only the markup, not the css part) explained in this article [Coding An HTML 5 Layout From Scratch](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/designing-a-html-5-layout-from-scratch/)
- Do different commits as you finish the different parts of the file
push your changes to the remote repository when you complete the markup
